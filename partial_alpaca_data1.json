Fleming had grown cultures of Staphylococci bacteria in a Petri dish, placing it in an open window to let air pass over the culture. Unbeknownst to him, the bacteria were destroyed by spores from a nearby mold. This inspired Fleming to further examine the mold and eventually, he managed to isolate a substance from it that killed a variety of bacterial pathogens. He identified it as an extract from the Penicillium notatum fungus, which he named \u201cpenicillin.\u201d \n\nIn 1939, Australian scientists Howard Florey and Ernest Chain confirmed Fleming\u2019s findings by growing the mold on large scale, and the drug was mass-produced for the Allied forces during World War II. After the war, penicillin was produced on a commercial scale and made accessible to everyone. \n\nPenicillin revolutionized the medical field, being the first antibiotic to successfully treat bacterial infections. It was also discovered to be effective against a number of other diseases and infections, such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and even anthrax. This discovery has saved countless lives and it is still used today to treat numerous diseases with varying degrees of effectiveness."

Some said it was an omen of good luck, while others believed it was a harbinger of destruction.\n\nRegardless of what it was, the mere presence of the creature was enough to make the local villagers tread carefully and tread lightly in the forest. Even so, the creature, whatever it was, continued to exist in the deep dark unknown."

After mustering up all of her courage, she opened the door and peered inside. What she found was astonishing- a room filled with trinkets, books, and artifacts that nearly took her breath away. Sitting atop of a shelf was an old, dusty book adorned with mysterious symbols. When Eliza opened the book, she was astonished to discover that it was full of ancient spells and charms.\n\nUtterly mesmerized, Eliza was determined to learn the secrets of magic and attempted to red the book. To her amazement, Eliza found she could understand the book's instructions and began practicing the spells and charms it contained. Soon, Eliza's room was filled with the smell of burning herbs and strange magical artifacts that seemed to whisper secrets to her.\n\nAs Eliza became more confident in her magic, she used it to help others in her village. In time, her magic was so powerful that it seemed as if miracles would happen whenever Eliza spoke a spell. Despite her newfound power, Eliza never used her gifts for evil or selfish purposes and her heart was always filled with love and compassion. \n\nThough she faced her fair share of danger and adventure, Eliza always managed to make it through thanks to the strength of her magic. Eliza's tale is a reminder to us all that true power comes not from magic, but from the heart."

Trump refused to accept these results, filing a number of lawsuits alleging that fraud had taken place, but the individual lawsuits did not successfully question the results.\n\nUltimately, Joe Biden won the election with 306 electoral votes while Donald Trump won 232. Biden also won the popular vote by a margin of more than 7 million votes. Biden's victory was seen as a repudiation of Trump, who became the first incumbent President to fail to win a second term since 1992. \n\nThe election showcased the political divide in the US, demonstrated by the divide between the popular vote and electoral vote. It also highlighted the different strategies deployed by the campaign teams, with Biden campaigning more digitally in light of the pandemic.\n\nThe 2020 US election will likely be remembered as one of the most important elections in history, one that saw an incumbent president questioning the results and fueling a culture of mistrust for democracy."

Modular programming also allows for greater scalability, as new modules can be added to the system at any time. Finally, modular programming can help improve code quality, as it encourages code reuse, code readability, and more efficient debugging."
